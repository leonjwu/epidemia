The epidemia package allows researchers to flexibly specify and fit
Bayesian epidemiological models in the style of [Flaxman et
al. (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7). The
package leverages R’s formula interface to paramaterize the time-varying
reproduction rate as a function of covariates. Multiple populations can
be modeled simultaneously with hierarchical models. The design of the
package has been inspired by, and has borrowed from,
[rstanarm](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/) (Goodrich et al. 2020).
epidemia uses [rstan](https://mc-stan.org/rstan/) (Stan Development Team
2020) as the backend for fitting models.

## Disclaimer

This is an early beta release of the package. As a beta release, there will be 
regular updates with additional features and more extensive testing. Any feedback is 
greatly appreciated - in particular if you find bugs, find the documentation unclear, or
have feature requests, please report them
[here](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/epidemia/issues).

This version of epidemia could be subject to future changes to the interface.

## Installation

The latest development version of the package can be installed using
``` r
#install.packages(devtools)
devtools::install_github("ImperialCollegeLondon/epidemia")
```
Vignettes are not currently included in the package because they are 
computationally demanding, and are best viewed online.

## Getting Started

The best way to get started is to read the
[vignettes](articles/index.html).

  - [Flexible Epidemic Modeling with
    epidemia](articles/introduction.html) is the main vignette,
    introducing the model framework and the primary model fitting
    function `epim`.
  - [Using Priors](articles/priors.html) gives important details behind 
    using prior distributions for model paramters.
  - [Incidence Only](articles/IncidenceOnly.html) gives examples of
    fitting models using only incidence data and a discrete serial
    interval.
  - [Time-Dependent Modeling](articles/TimeDependentR.html) demonstrate
    how to model weekly changes in the reproduction number as a random
    walk.
  - [Resolving Problems](articles/ResolvingProblems.html) will
    demonstrate how to resolve common computational problems when using the package.
  - [Forecasting](articles/forecasting.html) demonstrates how to evaluate the 
    forecasts of a fitted model.

## Usage

```{r exampleUsage}
library(epidemia)
options(mc.cores=parallel::detectCores())

data(EuropeCovid)
# Collect args for epim
args <- EuropeCovid
args$algorithm <- "sampling"
args$group_subset <- c("Germany", "United_Kingdom")
args$sampling_args <- list(iter=1e3,control=list(adapt_delta=0.95,max_treedepth=15),seed=12345)
args$formula <- R(country, date) ~ schools_universities + self_isolating_if_ill +
  public_events + lockdown + social_distancing_encouraged
args$prior <- shifted_gamma(shape = 1/6, scale = 1, shift = -log(1.05)/6)
fit <- do.call("epim", args)
```




```{r examplePlots}
# Inspect Rt
plot_rt(fit, group = "United_Kingdom", levels = c(20,50,80,95))
# And deaths
plot_obs(fit, type = "deaths", group = "United_Kingdom", levels = c(20,50,80,95))
```
